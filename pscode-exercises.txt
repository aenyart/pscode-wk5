// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num1%2 = 0
  print "even"
else
  print "odd"

divide a number by 2
if there is no remainder, print "even"
if there is a remainder, print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) [num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]
b) (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5) / 5
c) if num1 > num2 && num1 > num3 && num1 > num4 && num1 > num5
     print num1
   elif num2 > num3 && num2 > num4 && num2 > num5
     print num2
   elif num3 > num4 && num3 > num5
     print num3
   elif num4 > num5
     print num4
   else
     print num5

   if num1 < num2 && num1 < num3 && num1 < num4 && num1 < num5
     print num1
   elif num2 < num3 && num2 < num4 && num2 < num5
     print num2
   elif num3 < num4 && num3 < num5
     print num3
   elif num4 < num5
     print num4
   else
     print num5

d) For the average, all 5 numbers are added together and divided by the count of all of the numbers (5 in this case).
   For the maximum, I would normally just use a min() or max(), but I wasn't sure if that was cheating 
     so I compared the first number to the others. If it wasn't larger than all of the numbers, I did the 
     same with the second number, leaving the first out because we had already determined that it was not the
     largest. While this method would not initially catch the maximum if there were two identical maximum values,
     it would still end up printing the same thing.
   For the minimum, I did the inverse of the evaluation I used for the maximum. I compared the first number to the
     other 4, and if it was not smaller than all of them than I continued down the line.
